# Muqi-Guo-CSC-324-Individual_Project
For my individual project, I plan to explore how New Yorkers navigate NYC using Uber.
I compared the uber pickups across regions with respect to time to analyze how they distribute within NYC. 
I also used spatial data to visualize all of the pickup locations as well as the total number of pickups within each neighborhood.

Please refer to my time log within the Project Documentation file.
